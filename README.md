This is an E-Commerce Website Tutorial I am working on. Oh, and "Go Pack Go"


This is an e-commerce tutorial I am working on from M-Dev Entertainment on youtube. The goal is to solidify some key points when it comes to website design and reinforce some concepts I was having trouble with. I decided to make it my own by making it Green Bay Packers themed! It is far from a finished product, but I plan to post updates often. Please let me know if there is any way I can improve both from a technical standpoint and stylistically. Thank you!

The end product will be a fully functioning website with database connectivity that will allow a customer to create a user account, shop, and order a product.


The product is now finished. I have uploaded the files and uploaded a youtube video demo. You can run the file through XAMPP (localhost/proshop/index.php) or check out the youtube demonstration!
